            <h2>Hero Creation</h2>
            <p>
                Each Player needs to create a Hero. Use a 
                <a href="https://www.textfixer.com/tools/random-words.php">random word generator</a> 
                to generate a random word for each Player. This is 
                their <span class="keyword">core word</span>; the theme of their Hero and their 
                powers. Each Player should come up with <span class="keyword">three</span> 
                <span class="keyword">abilities</span>, a <span class="keyword">weakness</span>, and a <span class="keyword">heroic backstory</span>, all 
                based around their <span class="keyword">core word</span>. <span class="keyword">Abilities</span> are things 
                granted to them by their superpowers. Each Hero gets 
                three <span class="keyword">abilities</span>: a Utility (not damage dealing, but 
                potentially useful), a Melee (usable within arms’ 
                reach, and potentially damage dealing), and a 
                Ranged (out of arms’ reach, and potentially damage 
                dealing). Each ability costs different amounts of 
                <span class="keyword">Hero Points</span> to use, costing 1-, 2-, and 3HP 
                respectively, and requires a successful <span class="keyword">skill check</span>. 
                Their weakness is something that weakens them when 
                in close proximity, causing their powers to fail; 
                their <span class="keyword">abilities</span> cannot be used when near their 
                <span class="keyword">weakness</span>. Their <span class="keyword">backstory</span> is how they got their 
                powers and became a Hero. And don’t forget to 
                describe their costume, either.
            </p>

            <h2>Hero Points</h2>
            <p>
                Each Player starts with 10 <span class="keyword">Hero Points</span> (HP). HP can 
                be spent and recovered, and can can go over 10. HP 
                can be lost in three ways: using <span class="keyword">abilities</span>, ensuring 
                a <span class="keyword">skill check</span> succeeds, and taking damage. When they 
                reach 0HP, they cannot function as a Hero; they 
                cannot use their <span class="keyword">abilities</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, HP can be recovered by doing <span class="keyword">Heroic Things</span>: 
                rescuing someone, bemoaning their backstory, being 
                overly melodramatic about their <span class="keyword">weakness</span>. They 
                regain 1HP for each <span class="keyword">Heroic Thing</span> they do. They do 
                not lose HP for saving someone with their <span class="keyword">abilities</span>. 
                Also, for every round they are exposed to their 
                <span class="keyword">weakness</span>, they regain 1HP.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>The Game Master</h2>
            <p>
                Your job is to place the Heroes in a situation 
                where they face off against the Villain. It could 
                be a bank heist or a demonic ritual, but the Heroes 
                are always there to <span class="keyword">stop the villain</span>.
            </p>

            <h2>Villain Creation</h2>
            <p>
                The GM is in control of the Villain of this story. 
                A Villain is generated in the same way as a Hero, 
                but with a <span class="keyword">villainous backstory</span> instead of a heroic 
                one.
            </p>

            <h2>Villain Points</h2>
            <p>
                Instead of HP, the Villain starts the game with 15 
                Villain Points (VP). VP can be lost in the same way 
                as HP, but can never go over 15. When the Villain 
                reaches 0VP, <span class="keyword">they have been defeated</span>. VP can be 
                regained by doing <span class="keyword">Villainous Things</span>: endangering 
                people, being selfish, monologuing, etc. They regain 
                1VP for each Villainous Thing they do. As with 
                Heroes, for every round they are exposed to their 
                <span class="keyword">weakness</span>, they regain 1VP.
            </p>

            <h2>Civilians</h2>
            <p>
                A Civilian is anyone who is neither a Hero nor a 
                Villain. They each have 5 Civilian Points (CP) 
                which, unlike HP and VP, cannot be spent to do 
                anything, nor recovered outside of a hospital visit. 
                However, they can be lost when taking damage. When 
                a Civilian reaches 0CP, they are either unconscious 
                or dead. Civilians are generally controlled by the 
                GM and are there to get in the way.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Skill Checks</h2>
            <p>
                Whenever a character attempts something that an 
                average human couldn’t (picking a lock, jumping a 
                20ft. gap, etc.), or uses one of their <span class="keyword">abilities</span>, 
                the Player should roll a six-sided dice, aiming to 
                get a 4 or higher in order to succeed. This is a 
                <span class="keyword">skill check</span>. They can choose to spend points in 
                order to succeed; a success costs 1 point.
            </p>
            <p>
                Failing a roll does not mean instant death; it 
                merely means the task takes longer or a complication 
                arises, such as the Villain gets away, or you are 
                spotted doing something you shouldn’t.
            </p>

            <h2>Turn Order</h2>
            <p>
                Starting with the GM, go clockwise around the group. 
                Each player gets a turn, during which time they can 
                use an <span class="keyword">ability</span>, attempt a <span class="keyword">skill check</span>, do a <span class="keyword">Heroic 
                Thing</span>, or <span class="keyword">attack something</span>. There is no limit on how 
                far a character can move on a turn, however Civilians 
                might get in the way or the Hero could run out of 
                breath.
            </p>

            <h2>Attacking</h2>
            <p>
                When you attack anyone, both you and the person 
                you are attacking roll a six-sided die. The person 
                with the lowest roll loses points equal to the 
                difference between the rolls. This replaces the 
                <span class="keyword">skill check</span> on <span class="keyword">abilities</span> that cause damage.
