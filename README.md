# Stop the Villain

Have you ever wanted to be a Superhero?

Well, now you can in 3 simple steps: Generate a random word, flesh out your powerset, and roll some dice!

Of course, it's a little more complicated than that, so you'll have to read the rules. But don't worry! All the rules fit onto one side of A4 paper, so you don't have to get bogged down in pages of terms and conditions.

[Download the rules now](https://github.com/snailcreature/stopthevillain/raw/master/files/StopTheVillainVer0-4-1-beta.pdf) or check the repository above.
