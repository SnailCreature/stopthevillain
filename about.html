    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        Stop the Villain is a one-page tabletop role playing game, 
        developed by myself, Sam, with help from my friends. It draws 
        inspiration from 2 other TTRPG systems: Everyone Is John, and 
        Anime Campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
        Everyone Is John is another one-page TTRPG where each player 
        takes the role of a Voice in the head of an insane man named 
        John. The aim of the game is to take control of John for as 
        long as possible and complete your goals, or obsessions, 
        as many times as possible. The only problem is, even the 
        simplest everyday task is a minefield for the Voices, 
        potentially causing them to lose control. Everyone is John served as 
        inspiration for both the d6 dice system, and the absolute 
        mayhem that probable failure can cause.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anime Campaign is a much different game. Each player is 
        given a random core word, around which they build a unique 
        character and power set with the help of the Game Master 
        (GM). As the campaign progresses, the characters gain power, 
        their powers getting stronger and more random. The 
        inspiration here is obvious: The random core word. By 
        giving a player a concept to base their powers and character 
        on, you make it easier for them to create something on short 
        notice if they aren't particularly creative, or you allow 
        them to go wild if they are more creative.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is of course the added seasoning of a love of the MCU 
        and films like Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've only run very silly sessions of Stop the Villain, but it 
        should be possible to also run more serious games (though, 
        why would you?). Games tend to last over an hour, however it 
        depends on whether the players find the Villain's weakness 
        and whether the Heroes are exposed to their weaknesses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enjoy the games, and may the dice roll in your favour. 
        I look forward to hearing about your adventures.
